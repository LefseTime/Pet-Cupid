    about: 'Iris is a 3-month-old, cuddly kitten looking for her forever home!\n\nIris is a cat that greets her humans when they come home, since she prefers to hang around with them. She loves to cuddle on the couch in the evenings when sheâs not distracted by playing with her tail.\n\nHer favorite toy is her fake mouse. Sheâll carry it around with her for a while after playing. However, she also loves chasing string toys. When sheâs done playing, she likes to curl up next to her humans.\n\nSheâs a kitten and very curious, so she may pop up behind you to see what youâre doing and then run off to see where that random cord leads.\n\nAn ideal home would have another cat that will cuddle and play with Iris. She gets along with other animals but can be a bit reserved at first. However, she would do well in a family without other pets provided she gets all the pets and love you can offer her!\n\nAdoption fees include mandatory sales tax of 7.525%.\n\nAll cats have received comprehensive veterinary care and tested negative for feline leukemia and FIV.  Cats are up-to-date on vaccinations and have been spayed/neutered, treated  for fleas and/or ear mites and de-wormed, and microchipped. \n\nInterested in adopting or learning more about this cat?
